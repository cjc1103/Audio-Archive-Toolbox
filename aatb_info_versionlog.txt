Audio Archive Toolbox
Program history
 
1.0  2016-12-15
     Project initially called AARCO (Audio Archive Compression)
     Initial release (python), incorporating flac, mp3 compression, m3u playlists

1.1  2017-05-22
     Allow argv options from command line
     Checked for incompatible options, compress, decompress, verify, delete
     Reordered processing to immediately read in all files in a folder,
     determine their type, and enumerate them in the appropriate list
     Added aac compression (.m4a file extension), using faac, qaac, and nero

1.2  2017-06-06
     Added ogg vorbis compression (.ogg file extension)
     Rewrote program logic to allow more flexibility in processing compressed audio
     e.g. --m4a=24-48 will compress only 24-48 wav files to aac (m4a) format

1.3  2017-06-12
     Added opus compression (.opus file extension), opusinfo to calculate song duration.
     Rewrote GetTrackDuration module to use three different external utilities to
     calculate song duration in seconds for flac, wav, mp3, m4a, ogg, and opus files

2.0  2018-03-15
     Converted to C#, complete rewrite. Converted log functions to public class.
     Used C# walkdirectory function to walk directory tree recursively. Used
     DirectoryInfo and FileInfo types as much as possible, static (global) vars
     where necessary.

2.1  2018-05-24
     Changed shntool location to the "16-44.flacf" subdir
     Enabled decompress of both wav and raw audio files on same run
     Enabled "overwrite" flag to overwrite existing files

2.2  2018-06-02
     Copies info.txt file from root directory to compressed subdirectory being created,
     or being verified (with overwrite flag). Moved standalone playlist creation
     function under "Verify" option. Replaced obsolete faac codec with fdkaac codec
     Rewrote GetTrackDuration procedure to use mediainfo utility for all formats

2.3  2018-06-07
     Created AATB_DirInfo class to consolidate all directory metadata in one location
     AATB_DirInfo is instantiated every time WalkDirectoryTree procedure is executed,
     and a constructor initializes the metadata for each directory traversed

2.4  2018-06-17
     Replaced input argument flags for format and bitrate with a boolean array
     Changed argument parsing to pass option directly to SetFormatBitrate procedure
     The <bitrate> option in the command line is now the wav audio directory name,
     and should have a dash, e.g "16-44". The default directory names/bit rates are
     specified in the AudioFormats array.
     Added "allformats" and "allbitrates" options to command line
     Created separate PrintHelp procedure, checked for invalid command line arguments
     Rewrote IsFileUnix procedure to use the unix2dos information-conversion mode
     Changed logging procedure to write header and footer to console and log file
     Changed the "Delete WAV Audio" section to use the AudioFormatBitrate flag array

2.5  2018-07-02
     Replaced faac compression with Apple AAC Win64 (qaac64.exe)
     Recompiled fdkaac from ffmpeg sources for Win64 (fdkaac64.exe)
     Added capability to change compression level from command line:
       MP3 Variable Bit Rate Level  --mp3-level
       AAC Compression Type --aacCompType
       AAC quality --aacQuality --fdkaacQuality 
       OGG Quality -ogg-quality
       OPUS Bitrate --opus-bitrate
       FLAC compression level --flac-level
     Rewrote format conversion procedures to use FileInfo[], and moved metadata
       (MD5, FFP, SHNRPT) creation to main procedure
     Moved log time stamp to after the user accepts (enters "y") the command inputs
     Moved command line check code to separate procedure "CheckCommandLineInput"
     Added procedure to parse info.txt file for metadata (artist, album, track names)

2.6  2019-05-09
     Added 24 to 16 bit conversion option using the sox utility
     Changed AATB_DirInfo constructor to search for a date string 1xxx-xx-xx or 2xxx-xx-xx
       when calculating directory metadata
     Remove prefix numeric chars and spaces from audio compression subdirectory names
     Metadata still uses spaces from parent directory names, if they are present

3.0  2019-10-14
     Renamed project to "Audio Archive Toolbox" AATB
     Changed Log Init, Start, and Close to use the common Write and WriteLine procedures
     Changed Log Write and WriteLine procedures to throw an exception if log file was unwriteable
     ALLBITRATES switch now sets flags for all bitrates except RAW, which is set separately
       for wav->flac compression/flac->wav decompression of raw audio files

3.1  2019-11-02
     Fixed bug: raw audio files (RAW directory) would be compressed to lossy formats
     Fixed bug: flac raw audio files would not be decompressed
     Fixed bug: Artist and Album indexes off by one for commercial recordings (Artist - Title)
     Changed remove number prefix code in CreateDirName method to use Regex
     Fixed bug: Removed number prefix from Artist name, if present
     Rewrote ConvertWAVBitrate method to correctly build output filenames and do bitrate comparisons
     Added Date metadata tag for all compressed audio file utility arguments

3.2  2019-12-11
     Added GetMetaData method to parse *info.txt file (if it exists) for live recording metadata
       (Artist, Album, Venue, Location, Date, track titles), and to use this metadata
       to tag compressed files. This is restricted to <bitrate> audio file directories, the 
       info.txt file must be located in the parent directory.
     Added method to join tracked wav files into a combined wav file, using the shntool app
     Removed nero aac compression codec, as it is not supported by developer any longer
     Rewrote compressed audio file quality parameter handling, CheckQBounds, PrintQBounds

3.3  2020-01-08
     Fixed metaflac tagging, tags are now added correctly to flac files
     Added a rolling "Track..<tracknbr>.." log entry to provide user with feedback on conversion
       status for all compressed file conversion methods, mp3, m4a, ogg, opus, flac, wav
     Added log messages for creating/verifying checksum, ffp, shntool files
     Changed Verify code to correctly overwrite shn, ffp, md5 files when using boolOverwrite flag
     Changed external process exception handling to a generic exception, this will catch
      any error resulting from the external program and write the error message to the log.

3.4  2020-01-18
     Changed Convert code to get target bitrate from argument --convert=<bitrate>, and
       get input bitrate for wav files in <bitrate> directory --wav=<bitrate>
     Changed command line checking code to:
       (1) abort if more than one primary option selected
       (2) check only one WAV bitrate is set for Convert option
     Initialized audio compression q defaults at beginning of Main method
     Changed input section to check audio compression q bounds immediately after parsing q value
     Changed "help" method to display q values and defaults as variables

3.5  2020-03-11
     Separated metadata handling method into two parts
       GetDirMetadata to populate Dir variables (all directories traversed except for root directory)
       GetTrackMetadata to populate Track and TrackDuration lists for Compress and Verify sections
     Metadata handling now allows import of metadata using an info.txt information file
     Moved some metadata initialation from the AATB_Dir constructor to the GetDirMetaData method
     Added TrackDurationList string list to AATB_Dir class
     Removed GetSongTitle method, as its function was incorporated into GetTrackMetaData
     Removed fdkaac and faac AAC codecs, and qaac is the only supported AAC codec
     Removed --aacCompType flag to select differnt aac codecs
     Changed all ConvertWAVToXXX methods to get song duration data from the Dir.TrackDurationList list
     Added boolCreateCuesheet method to create a CD cuesheet for each compressed audio directory
     boolCreateM3UPlaylist now rounds TrackDuration to nearest integer instead of truncating

3.6  2020-04-08
     Separated methods into files, using the partial class attribute
     Created RunProcess method to run external processes, and changed all calls to external programs
       to use RunProcess method. RunProcess will redirect Standard Output and Error messages, which
       requires flac to suppress all output, as encoding 24 bit files results in an error message,
     GetDirMetadata and GetTrackData methods - changed to identify recordings as Live, Commercial or
       Other, remove spaces from live recording directory names, correctly read data from info file
       and remove prefix/suffixes from Artist name, song titles. GetDirMetaData is called for every
       directory in tree. GetTrackmetaData is only called when needed by Compress and Verify sections
       to identify song metadata
     Rewrote CheckCommandLine method to streamline code and created PrintCompressionOptions method
       to combine all printing of command line compression options
     Created -v|--verify --tag option, to rewrite all tags for each audio track in a directory
       this requires updating the md5 checksums. The ffp checksums and shntool reports for flac files
       are not updated, as they do not change (ffp is the checksum of all audio without metadata).
       However they can be rewritten if desired using the --ffp and --shn options respectively.

4.0  2020-05-02
     Updated GetDirMetadata and GetTrackMetadata methods to read metadata from cue sheets,
       using the CD cuesheet standard as implemented by Exact Audio Copy
     Added Dir.ArtistList data structure as string[], to store Artist names for each track. This list
       is populated with Artist data from the cuesheet, if used, otherwise all entries use AlbumArtist
     Modified all audio compression methods to use the Dir.ArtistList list
     Various variable renaming and code cleanup. Rewrote SplitString method.
     Added command line options
       --info-metadata (live format only) use info.txt file in root directory for album and track metadata
       --cue-metadata (CD format only) use cuesheet in wav file directory <bitrate> for track metadata
       these two options are mutually exclusive, can't use both at once
       --create-cue (subordinate to verify function) creates cue file in wav file directory <bitrate>

4.1  2020-06-06
     Separated GetTrackMetadata into four separate methods: primary, info file, cuesheet, filename
       the primary method will decide which sub methods to call. This enables info and cuesheet methods
       to call the default filename method in case of input error
     Fixed bug in GetDirMetadata to account for parent directory name starting with a date yyyy-mm-dd
     Changed Dir class to add "Comment" string
     Changed GetDirInfoFromInfotext method to accept a comment in line 4, and date in line 5 (changed in 4.3)
     Modified GetTrackMetadataFromInfotext to recognize various track numbering schemes in info.txt file:
       d.  Title
       dd. Title
       dd Title
     Removed redundant ParseArg method, command line parsing now uses SplitString method with "=" delimiter

4.2  2021-04-26
     Changed verify function to allow checking/creating md5/ffp/shn checksums and music tags independently
     Moved Create Cuesheet from a verify option to a primary function
     Fixed GetMetadataFromInfotext method to stop adding titles when the track count equals the file count
       if the track count is less than the file count, then it reverts to using filenames for metadata
     Fixed GetMetadataFromInfotext method to ignore all characters in song title after a left parent "("
       Comments in parentheses are ignored even if other trailing characters are present
     Changed GetMetaData method to always use parent directory name for subdirectories even if using
       info.txt or cuesheet files. Artist, Venue, Stage, Location from info files is used for metadata. 
     Changed incrementing TrackNbr to start of loop in each method using this counter
     Streamlined and corrected bugs in ConvertWAVBitrate method, now uses Regex to build output filenames
     Changed command line input to accept any bitrate for mp3's, although the resultant files for bitrates
       greater than 16-44 will be increased (e.g. 24-48 mp3's are about 4% bigger than 16-44 equivalents)

4.3  2021-05-20
     Fixed bugs in GetDirMetadata to work correctly with info file using Compress and Verify functions
     Changed GetTrackMetadataFromInfotext to detect blank titles in info file, and change them to "Track dd"
     Changed GetDirMetadata to remove index number (at least one decimal number followed by space) from
       the beginning of Artist Name
     Fixed bug in VerifySHNReport method, where program would read past EOF

4.4	 2021-06-10
     Changed GetDirMetadatafromInfotext and GetDirMetadataFromCuesheet methods to search for labels using a
       common method called SearchFile. Label names are hard coded into these methods.
     Fixed CreateCuesheet method to use info.txt file for track metadata and output to info.cue file
     Rewrote VerifyMD5Checksum and VerifyFFPChecksum methods to correct a problem where checksums would
       not be verified unless the -o|--overwrite flag was set.
     Cleaned up VerifyMD5Checksum, VerifyFFPChecksum, VerifySHNReport to assume FileList is non-zero and
       replace case statement with if-then-else
     Changed GetTrackDuration method to exit program if Mediainfo returns null. This probably means the
       user is using the Windows GUI version of the program, not the CLI version
     Removed -i|--use-infotext option requirement for creating cuesheets. If an info file is not present
       track metadata will be derived from filenames

4.5  2021-06-26	   
     Various code cleanups and variable renaming for consistency
	 Removed MD5FileName, FFPFileName, SHNFileName variables as they were redundant
	 Changed VerifySHNReport method to check bitrate 16-44 for CDR errors
	 Fixed off by one errors in VerifySHNReport method:
       when starting data checking, now starts at line=1, WAV problem flags now start at char=44
	 Deleted null filename checks in CopyTextFile method as it was redundant
	 
4.6	 2021-09-17
	 Updated .NET to 5.0 (required recreating project from backup files using .NET 5.0 template)

4.7  2021-11-30
	 Changed Verify functions to print "Verifying xxxx.." without a linefeed, then when verification is
       complete, print "OK" on the same line to give feedback to the user.
     Created compression, decompression, and tag files and combined all related methods into the appropriate
       file. Changed these methods to include the string "CompType" which is used in a case statement
       to assign the correct external program name and argument string

4.8	 2021-12-12
	 Corrected inconsistencies in CheckUserInput
	 Fixed external parameter errors in Compression, Decompression, and Tag Audio methods from 4.7 update
	 Fixed status message inconsistencies throughout entire program

     Added input option -l|--lower-case to optionally convert artist and stage name to lower case
	 Added ConvertCase method to check the new flags and convert case as appropriate for directory names
     Changed GetDirMetadata method for logging messages when getting metadata from infotext and cuesheet

5.0  2022-02-07
     Changed and consolidated algorithm logic for compress, verify, and decompress audio sections
     Replaced duplicative code with a loop to check all compression formats, and only operate on formats
     and bitrates that are selected through the command line for each mode.

5.2  2022-04-14
     Added join function using SoX utility to concatenate wav or flac audio files into one joined file
     Modified Compress function to only generate MD5 FFP and SHNRPT reports if the appropriate flag is set
     SHNRPT function (shntool len report) requires FLAC 1.3.2 for 24 bit FLACs, does not work with 1.3.4
     Changed Dir structure to add ParentInfotextPath and ParentCuesheetPath
     Changed all references to ParentInfotextPath and ParentCuesheetPath to the Dir variables
     Enforced standard naming scheme for parent infotext and cuesheet files, if they are not in the
     correct format, the files are renamed.

5.3  2022-05-18
     Added SplitFileName method, as the SplitFilePath method returned the pathname which was not been used
     Revised GetTrackMetadataFromCuesheet method so Performer entry is optional for each track

     Changed GetTrackMetadataFromInfotext and GetTrackMetadataFromCuesheet to only print track artist if
       it is present (encased in square brackets)
     Changed WalkDirectoryTree to not call GetTrackMetaData method for raw audio
     Changed CompressFromWAV method to not use tags when compressing raw WAV files to FLAC

     Added Verbose flag to enable logging StandardError stream
     Added PrintOutputStream method to
      (1) log StandardOutput stream in "Debug" mode
      (2) log any line in StandardError stream that contains the word "error" in "Verbose" mode
      (3) log entire StandardError stream in "Debug" and "Verbose" modes

5.6 2023-01-05
    Removed redundant check for TRACKEDAUDIO dir type from create cuesheet section of Program method
    Added SplitDataByLine method to split data stream into an array of lines separated by
      dos|unix line delimiters <cr> <line feed> <return>
    Added exception handling to PrintOutputStream method, changed print formatting
    Added exception handling to decimal calculations in CreateM3UPlaylist method
    Removed redundant TrackDuration calculation from CreateM3UPlayList method, and instead retrieved

      the accompanying setlist in infotext file
	Streamlined generation of metadata terms from infotext and cuesheet files, and moved GetTrackDuration
      to a new method PopulateTrackDurationList, and also enabled proper exception handling for file access.
    Added SearchListForDate method to search for a valid concert date in an infotext file

5.8 2023-05-14
